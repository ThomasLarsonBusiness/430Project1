# 430Project1
This was a project I made while in IGME 430, learning NodeJS and the HTTP library. This website is a squadron creator for the board game X-Wing Tabletop Miniatures, a game where players take turns piloting a squadron of ships from the Star Wars universe trying to out-dogfight their opponent. This website lets users create a new squadron and edit the pilots inside of that sqadron.

This data is stored for half an hour, as after half an hour the webserver restarts and at this point we had not learned how to use a database.
